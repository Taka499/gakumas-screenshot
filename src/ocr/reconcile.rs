//! Checksum-based reconstruction of per-character scores corrupted by the

//!
//! When two adjacent per-character scores are both >= 1,000,000 the game renders
//! them so close that the right number's leading "1" overlaps the left number's
//! last digit. OCR then drops the right "1" and may misread the left number's
//! units digit. The screen also shows an isolated stage total and a bonus badge,
//! and the game guarantees the exact identity
//!
//!     stage_total = c1 + c2 + c3 + floor(max(c1, c2, c3) / 5)
//!
//! (the bonus is `floor(max/5)`), so `reconcile_stage` reconstructs the true
//! scores from the total alone via a small exhaustive search, using the bonus
//! only as an optional cross-check.
