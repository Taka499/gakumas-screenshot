# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in docs/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

When working on execution plans (ExecPlans), always read the full plan document completely before beginning any implementation or summarization. Confirm understanding by listing all milestones/phases before proceeding.

Active ExecPlans (keep their `Progress` sections current; each is self-contained):
- `docs/EXECPLAN_RESUME_AUTOMATION.md` - resume an interrupted automation run. Complete (committed d968a4a, acceptance passed).
- `docs/EXECPLAN_GUI_STATE_DRIVEN_PANEL.md` - redesign the GUI third column into a state-driven control panel. Not started; M1 (scroll) then M2 (state-driven panel). See its Progress section for status.


## Project Overview

Windows screenshot tool that captures the client area of `gakumas.exe` using Windows Graphics Capture API. Runs as a system tray application with global hotkey support. Includes rehearsal automation with embedded Tesseract OCR.

## COMMIT DISCIPLINE
- Follow Git-flow workflow to manage the branches
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
- Only add and commit affected files. Keep untracked other files as are
- Never add Claude Code attribution in commit

## Build Commands

Build emits ~30 expected warnings (unused `pub use` re-exports, OCR dead code); these are not regressions. Filter with `cargo check 2>&1 | grep "^error"` to find real failures.

```powershell
# Build release (optimized with LTO)
cargo build --release

# Create release package with proper folder structure
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package-release.ps1

# Run
.\target\release\gakumas-screenshot.exe
```

## Architecture

Multi-module Rust application with these key components:

- **src/main.rs**: Entry point, initializes GUI or legacy tray mode
- **src/paths.rs**: Centralized path resolution (logs/, screenshots/, output/, template/, tesseract/)
- **src/gui/**: egui-based GUI window with progress display, controls, and guide images
- **src/capture/**: Window discovery and screenshot capture via Windows Graphics Capture API
- **src/automation/**: Rehearsal automation state machine, button detection, OCR worker, session metadata/resume (`session_meta.rs`)
- **src/calibration/**: Interactive calibration wizard for button positions
- **src/ocr/**: Tesseract integration with per-stage crop→threshold→OCR→extract pipeline
- **src/analysis/**: Statistics calculation and chart generation (plotters)

Key technical details:
- **Window Discovery**: `EnumWindows` + `QueryFullProcessImageNameW` to find target process
- **Screen Capture**: Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) API via `IGraphicsCaptureItemInterop::CreateForWindow`
- **GPU Pipeline**: D3D11 device creates staging texture, copies captured frame, maps for CPU read
- **Embedded Tesseract**: `include_bytes!` embeds tesseract.zip, extracted on first run to exe directory
- **OCR Pipeline**: Per-stage cropping (`score_regions` in config) → brightness thresholding → Tesseract `--psm 6` → sanitize leading garbage chars → regex extraction. Each stage processed independently to avoid cross-stage noise. Crop regions are tightened to exclude horizontal UI divider lines that confuse Tesseract layout analysis
- **Session folders**: Each automation series writes to `output/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` holding `screenshots/`, `results.csv`, `session.log`, `charts/`, and `run-meta.json`. `run-meta.json` (written by `session_meta.rs`) records `total`/`completed`/`status` so an interrupted series can resume into the same folder; `completed` is authoritatively recomputed from the screenshot count (crash-proof), not trusted from the file

## Key Constants and Hotkeys

- Process matching: exact match `"gakumas.exe"` (case-insensitive)
- `HOTKEY_ID` (1): Ctrl+Shift+S - Screenshot
- `HOTKEY_AUTOMATION` (6): Ctrl+Shift+A - Start automation
- `HOTKEY_ABORT` (7): Ctrl+Shift+Q - Abort automation
- `HOTKEY_CLICK_TEST` (2): Ctrl+Shift+F9 - PostMessage click test
- `HOTKEY_SENDINPUT_TEST` (3): Ctrl+Shift+F10 - SendInput click test
- Output: `screenshots/gakumas_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`
- Log: `logs/gakumas_screenshot.log`
- Reference images: `resources/template/rehearsal/*.png`

## Windows API Notes

- Uses Rust 2024 edition requiring explicit `unsafe` blocks inside `unsafe fn`
- `EnumWindows` returns FALSE when callback stops early - don't treat as error
- `windows` crate v0.58 feature flags must match APIs used (see Cargo.toml)
- `SendInput` with `SetForegroundWindow` is required for game input (PostMessage is ignored)
- Must run as Administrator if game runs elevated (UIPI restriction)

## Design Constraints

- **Admin privileges required**: The executable has a Windows manifest (`gakumas-screenshot.exe.manifest`) that requires administrator elevation. This is necessary for `SendInput` to work with elevated game processes.
- **No command-line arguments**: This is a system tray application, not a CLI tool. All functionality should be accessed via tray menu, hotkeys, or config file. Do not add command-line argument handling.
- **Testing limitations**: Unit tests requiring the binary cannot run from `cargo test` due to the admin manifest. Test functionality manually via tray menu or create separate test utilities if needed.

## Roadmap

See `docs/ROADMAP_AUTOMATION.md` for the full automation feature roadmap. Current status:
- Phase 1: UI automation (clicking buttons) - complete
- Phase 2: OCR integration (Tesseract) - complete with embedded Tesseract
- Phase 3: Automation loop - complete with state machine
- Phase 4: Statistics and visualization - complete (CSV, charts, JSON)
- Phase 5: User interface - in progress (egui GUI implemented; resume of interrupted runs added; third-column UI redesign pending, see Active ExecPlans)
